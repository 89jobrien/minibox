## Branches Integrated

- `feat/a` → merged at `abc1234`
- `feat/b` → merged at `def5678`
- `feat/c` → merged at `ghi9012`

## Failed / Skipped

- `feat/d` — tests failed after rebase (see notes)

## Notes

- `feat/d`: `crates/baz/src/lib.rs` test `test_timeout_behavior` failed after rebase onto main.
  Root cause: `feat/d` assumed `MockRuntime::new()` returns `Ok(Self)` but main changed it to
  infallible. Fixed by unwrapping in test; re-ran `cargo test --workspace` — passes.
