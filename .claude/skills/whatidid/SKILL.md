# What Did I Do — Daily Activity Report

## Overview

Produces a structured "what did I do today" report by reading Claude Code session
JSONL files, extracting user instructions and tool summaries, calling the Anthropic
API for goal/task analysis, and rendering an HTML report with KPI cards, goals table,
and token cost breakdown.

The report answers: what goals were pursued, what tasks were completed, how much time
was spent, and what the ROI was relative to the seat cost.

## When to Use

- At the end of a workday to generate a standup/status report
- When you need an objective log of what was worked on for a given date
- When asked to "report on today", "what did I do", or given a date argument

**Not for:** Real-time session introspection, cross-repo analysis beyond git metadata,
or project planning.

## Steps

### 1. Resolve the target date

Use `$ARGUMENTS` if provided (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`). Otherwise default to today.

### 2. Harvest session data

Run `helpers/harvest.rs [YYYY-MM-DD]` via `rust-script`.

Scans all `~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/*.jsonl` files. Each JSONL line has a
`timestamp` field (ISO 8601). Events with a matching date prefix are included.

Key event types extracted:

- `type: "human"` → `message.content[].text` (user instructions; noise-filtered)
- `type: "assistant"` → `message.content[]` text blocks + `tool_use` names
- Metadata from every line: `cwd`, `gitBranch`, `sessionId`, `slug`

Noise filtered from human turns: single-word confirmations ("ok", "yes", "act"),
`<system-reminder>` injections, `<current_datetime>` tags.

Output: JSON array of session records with `messages[]`, `tool_calls`, `read_calls`,
`edit_calls`, `bash_calls`.

### 3. Analyze with Anthropic API

Run `helpers/analyze.rs <sessions.json> [YYYY-MM-DD]` via `rust-script`.

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in environment. Inject via:

```nu
op run --env-file=$HOME/dev/.env -- rust-script helpers/whatidid.rs
```

Builds a transcript from harvested sessions (cwd, branch, SIGNALS block with tool
counts, then interleaved human/assistant turns). Sends to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.

Model prompt lives in `prompts/analysis.txt`. Returns structured JSON digest:
`goals[]` each with `tasks[]`, `human_hours`, `domain_skills`, `tech_skills`.

Caches result to `cache/YYYY-MM-DD.json` — re-runs skip the API call.

### 4. Compute KPIs

```
total_human_hours  = sum(goal.human_hours for goal in goals)
human_value        = total_human_hours × 72          # $72/hr blended rate
seat_cost_per_mo   = 39                              # Claude Code Pro seat
leverage           = human_value / seat_cost_per_mo
```

Token cost model: prefix-matched against `report.rs → MODEL_PRICING`.
Fallback: $3.00 input / $15.00 output per 1M tokens.

### 5. Generate HTML report

Run `helpers/report.rs <digest.json> [YYYY-MM-DD]` via `rust-script`.

Layout:

```
Header bar   — date, primary_focus, session count
Narrative    — day_narrative (2 sentences from digest)
KPI cards    — Hours | Human value | Leverage
Goals table  — Goal | Tasks (bullet list) | Hours | Skills
```

Written to `/tmp/whatidid-YYYY-MM-DD.html`. Opened automatically via `open`.

### 6. Report to user

```
[1/3] harvesting sessions for 2026-05-17...
[2/3] analyzing with Claude...
[3/3] rendering report...
Date: 2026-05-17  |  Goals: 5  |  Hours: 6.5h
Human value: $468  |  Leverage: 12x
Report: /tmp/whatidid-2026-05-17.html
```

## Token Cost Model

| Provider  | Model prefix     | Input $/1M | Output $/1M |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Anthropic | claude-opus-4    | $15.00     | $75.00      |
| Anthropic | claude-sonnet-4  | $3.00      | $15.00      |
| Anthropic | claude-haiku     | $0.80      | $4.00       |
| OpenAI    | gpt-5, gpt-4o    | $2.50      | $10.00      |
| OpenAI    | gpt-4.1          | $2.00      | $8.00       |
| OpenAI    | o3               | $10.00     | $40.00      |
| Google    | gemini-2.5-pro   | $1.25      | $10.00      |
| Google    | gemini-2.5-flash | $0.15      | $0.60       |

Fallback (unknown model): $3.00 input / $15.00 output.

Update `report.py → _MODEL_PRICING` when rates change.

## Common Mistakes

- **Including injected context as user instructions** — filter `<current_datetime>`,
  `<system-reminder>`, and single-word approval messages ("ok", "yes", "go") before
  building the transcript.
- **Double-counting sessions** — a single working session may span midnight; use
  `created_at` (session start) not `updated_at` as the date key.
- **Calling the API without a cached result check** — always check
  `cache/YYYY-MM-DD.json` before hitting GitHub Models; the API has rate limits.
- **Hardcoding model names** — use prefix matching in `_MODEL_PRICING` so new model
  variants don't silently fall through to zero cost.
